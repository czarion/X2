JACCARD 

This code calculates the similarity between two books (represented as sets of words) using the Jaccard Similarity measure.
The program reads two text files (books) and extracts words, removing any non-alphabetic characters.
It then calculates the Jaccard similarity between the two sets of words, which is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the two sets.
